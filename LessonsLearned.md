### Lessons learned about teaching
* Don't use `var` in class notes
* Provide a grading rubric with each assignment
* Give grades saying how much they lost for what
* It was a good idea to get student surveys one class 0
* Interactive classes
** Make a seating chart with names, don't enforce it, just use it
** Work in small groups (they all have computers with them)
*** Large groups will just have people sitting around
** ask for questions
** ask for answers, call on people
* If i update my stuff to the latest, the whole class will always be a version behind.
** pick an SDK version, a VS version, and stay with it.
** This applies to sample code, starter code, and class projects.
